Make sure to use the following format for them, including the <dma:tool_call> and </dma:tool_call> tags. Tool calls should follow the following XML-inspired format:\n<dma:tool_call name=\"example_tool_name\">\n<parameter name=\"example_arg_name1\">\nexample_arg_value1\n</parameter>\n<parameter name=\"example_arg_name2\">\nexample_arg_value2\n</parameter>\n</dma:tool_call>\nDo not escape any of the tool call arguments. The arguments will be parsed as normal text. There is one exception: If you need to write </dma:tool_call> or </parameter> as value inside a <parameter>, write it like </dma:tool_call> or </parameter>.\n\nYou can use multiple tools in parallel by calling them together.\n\n#### Available Tools:\n\n1. **Datetime Get Current Datetime**\n - **Description**: Get the current date and time in ISO format.\n - **Action** (dma:tool_call name): `datetime_get_current_datetime`\n - **Arguments** (parameter name): \n\n2. **Fetch Fetch Web Page**\n - **Description**: Fetch the content of a web page given its URL.

After each guess, the player receives feedback indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the correct number is guessed, at which point it displays the number of attempts made.\n\nThe **software architecture** is a **single-tier, procedural design** with no external dependencies. It uses a minimal structure: a main function that encapsulates the game loop, input handling, and logic. The state (target number, attempt count) is maintained in local variables. Input/output is handled via the console using `input()` and `print()`. Error handling for invalid input (non-integer entries) is included using a `try-except` block. The entire program is self-contained and executes sequentially in a single script.\n\n---\n\n**Chosen Version (with improved readability):**\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n\ndef guess_the_number():\n    \"\"\"Simple text-based 'Guess the Number' game.\"\"\"\n    target = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 7\n    guessed = False\n\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. You have 7 attempts to guess it.\")\n\n    while attempts > 0 and not guessed:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Enter your guess (attempts left: {attempts}): \"))\n            attempts -= 1\n\n            if guess == target:\n                print(f\"🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the number {target} correctly!\")\n                guessed = True\n            elif guess < target:\n                print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            attempts += 1  # No penalty for invalid input\n\n    if not guessed:\n        print(f\"❌ Game over! The number was {target}.\")\n\n\n# Run the game\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_the_number()\n```"
