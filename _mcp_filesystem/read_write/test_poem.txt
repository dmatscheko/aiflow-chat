Echoes in the Stillness
Where silence hums and thoughts take flight
Beneath the ancient oak tree,
Where shadows dance and dreams flee,
The wind sings secrets old and deep,
Of oceans lost and mountains steep.

It carries tales from distant shores,
Of sailors lost and lovers' cores,
And in its breath, a lullaby,
As twilight paints the sky.

So listen close when night descends,
And let the wind your spirit send
To realms where time and stars entwineâ€”
The world is vast, and you are mine.
