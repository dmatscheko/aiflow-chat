In twilight's hush, where shadows play,  
A single star begins to sway.  
It whispers tales of distant skies,  
Beneath the moon's soft, silver eyes.  

The wind, a bard with gentle breath,  
Sings secrets only night can tell.  
And in the stillness, hearts take flightâ€”  
Bathed in the glow of endless night.
