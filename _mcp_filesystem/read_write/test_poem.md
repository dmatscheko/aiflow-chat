# Test Poem

Beneath the velvet cloak of night so deep,
Where stars like diamonds weave a golden thread,
The moon, a silent sentinel, keeps watch,
And paints the world in silver, soft and high.

A gentle breeze through ancient oaks does sigh,
Whispering secrets to the sleeping trees,
While shadows dance where moonbeams softly lie,
And dreams take flight on silent, silvered seas.

Oh, night, your beauty is a sacred flame,
A timeless hymn that whispers through the air,
A gentle lullaby, a quiet name,
That soothes the soul beyond all mortal care.
